<h1>The Zone Diet</h1>
    <p><h3>WHAT IS THE ZONE DIET?</h3>
The Zone Diet was developed by Dr. Barry Sears more than 30 years ago to reduce diet-induced inflammation.

The Zone Diet will help you shed excess pounds and improve your mental and physical performance while living a more fulfilling life. The Zone Diet is a life-long dietary program based on strong science to reduce diet-induced inflammation.

<h4>WHAT IS THE ZONE?</h4>
The Zone is a real physiological state in your body that can be measured in clinical tests. If you are in the Zone, you have optimized your ability to control diet-induced inflammation. This inflammation is the reason you gain weight, become sick, and age faster.

There are three clinical markers that define if you are in the Zone. If all three clinical markers are within their ideal values, you are in the Zone. Otherwise, you are not.
