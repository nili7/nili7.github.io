<h1>Vegetarian Diet</h1>
    <p><h3>What is Veganism?</h3>
Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, and the flesh of any other animal), and may also include abstention from by-products of animal slaughter.


<h4>Types of Vegetarian?</h4>
There are a number of vegetarian diets that exclude or include various foods:

<b>Buddhist vegetarianism</b>-Different Buddhist traditions have differing teachings on diet, which may also vary for ordained monks and nuns compared to others. Many interpret the precept "not to kill" to require abstinence from meat, but not all. In Taiwan, su vegetarianism excludes not only all animal products but also vegetables in the allium family (which have the characteristic aroma of onion and garlic): onion, garlic, scallions, leeks, chives, or shallots.
<b>Fruitarianism and Jain vegetarianism</b>-Permit only fruit, nuts, seeds, and other plant matter that can be gathered without harming the plant.[39] Jain vegetarianism also includes dairy.
<b>Macrobiotic diets</b>- consist mostly of whole grains and beans.
<b>Lacto vegetarianism </b>-includes dairy products but not eggs.
<b>Ovo vegetarianism</b>- includes eggs but not dairy products.
<b>Ovo-lacto vegetarianism </b>-(or lacto-ovo vegetarianism) includes animal products such as eggs, milk, and honey.
<b>Sattvic diet</b>- (also known as yogic diet), a plant-based diet which may also include dairy and honey, but excludes eggs, red lentils, durian, mushrooms, alliums, blue cheeses, fermented foods or sauces, and alcoholic drinks. Coffee, black or green tea, chocolate, nutmeg, and any other type of stimulant (including excessively pungent spices) are sometimes excluded, as well.
