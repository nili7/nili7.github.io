<h1>South Beach Diet</h1>
    <p><h3>What Is the South Beach Diet?</h3>
The South Beach Diet was created in the mid-1990s by Dr. Arthur Agatston, a Florida-based cardiologist. His work in heart disease research led to the development of the Agatston score, which measures the amount of calcium in the coronary arteries.


<h4>How Does the South Beach Diet Work?</h4>
<b>Phase 1</b>
Phase 1 lasts 14 days.
It's considered the strictest phase because it limits fruit, grains and other higher-carb foods in order to decrease blood sugar and insulin levels, stabilize hunger and reduce cravings.
Most people can expect to lose 8-13 pounds (3.5-6 kg) of body weight during this phase.
During phase 1, you consume three meals per day composed of lean protein, non-starchy vegetables and small amounts of healthy fat and legumes.
In addition, you consume two mandatory snacks per day, preferably a combination of lean protein and vegetables.

<b>Phase 2</b>
This phase begins on day 15 and should be maintained for as many weeks as necessary to achieve your goal weight.
You can expect to lose 1-2 pounds (0.5-1 kg) per week during this phase, on average.
During phase 2, all foods from phase 1 are allowed, plus limited portions of fruit and "good carbs," such as whole grains and certain types of alcohol.

<b>Phase 3</b>
Once you achieve your target weight, you advance to phase three.
In this stage, although the phase-2 guidelines should be the basis for your lifestyle, occasional treats are allowed and no foods are truly off limits.
However, if you overindulge and start putting on weight, Dr. Agatston recommends returning to phase 1 for one to two weeks before returning to phase three.
In The South Beach Diet Supercharged, Dr. Agatston also recommends regular exercise and provides a three-phase fitness program to accompany the diet phases.
