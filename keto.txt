<h1>Keto Diet</h1>
    <p><h3>How Does a Keto Diet Work?</h3>
A keto or ketogenic diet is a very low-carb diet, which can help you burn fat more effectively. Many people have already experienced its many proven benefits for weight loss, health and performance. It's also used and recommended by many doctors.
On a ketogenic diet, your entire body switches its fuel supply to run mostly on fat, burning fat 24-7. When insulin levels become very low, fat burning can increase dramatically. It becomes easier to access your fat stores to burn them off. This is great if you're trying to lose weight, but there are also other less obvious benefits, such as less hunger and a steady supply of energy. This may help keep you alert and focused.

When the body produces ketones, it enters a metabolic state called ketosis. The fastest way to get there is by fasting - not eating anything - but nobody can fast forever.

A keto diet, on the other hand, can be eaten indefinitely and also results in ketosis. It has many of the benefits of fasting - including weight loss - without having to fast.


There are controversies and myths about a keto diet, but for most people it appears to be very safe.10 There are, however, three groups that often require special consideration:

<h4>Who should NOT do a ketogenic diet?</h4>
Do you take medication for diabetes, e.g. insulin? More 
Do you take medication for high blood pressure? More 
Do you breastfeed? More
