    <p><h3>How Does a Low Carb Diet Work?</h3>
Not everyone's body responds the same way to different approaches to losing weight. The key is to find a match for your body and metabolism.

Dr. Atkins, a well-known cardiologist, limited his patients' intake of sugar and carbohydrates. As a result, many of his patients successfully lost weight and kept it off - even though they had previously been unsuccessful on regular low-calorie diets!

<h4>Benefits of a Low Carb Diet</h4>
Carbs and weight loss are closely related. Everyone's metabolism can use two different types of fuel for energy - either sugar (and carbs that are quickly turned into sugar by the body), or fat. But the type of fuel you burn can have a big difference in losing or maintaining weight. A typical diet reduces calories, but is still high in carbohydrates (and thus sugar). As a result, many people constantly cycle between sugar "highs" (where excess sugar is actually stored as fat in the body) and sugar "lows" (where you feel fatigued and ravenously hungry - for more carbs and sugar). For many, it's really hard to lose weight that way.

Atkins, on the other hand, limits carbohydrates (sugar), so the body burns fat, including body fat, for fuel. This approach leaves the body steadily fueled, and weight is lost, even when more calories are being consumed. Steady fueling also means more constant energy levels all day long, and less hunger and cravings! You can actually lose weight while feeling full! The science behind the Atkins principles has been proven by over 80 clinical studies!

If counting calories didn't cut it - try Atkins - it may be the perfect approach for you!</p>
