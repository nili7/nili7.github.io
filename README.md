# Health&U
Food blog





Project
Introduction

 



Our project
‘Health&U’ is a food blog aiming to help people who want to lead a healthy
life. Our web application includes varieties of healthy diet options which cater
to the need of different people. Our users can subscribe to our blog to get new
notifications and they can also be a part of our forum where they can ask any
questions related to their diets and other users can respond to these
questions.



Our users will get
the latest news, tips and tricks on healthy lifestyle and diet. They can also
take quizzes to know where they lie on the health meter. They can send us their
queries or reviews as well. 



 



Project Scope

 



In future, we plan
to extend the blog functionality to our users where they can post their own
articles on health and related subjects after getting verified by the admin. We
will also add functionalities like videos and tutorials to help the users in a
better and wholesome way. We will try to bring health experts on board with us
who can give live advices to our users.
